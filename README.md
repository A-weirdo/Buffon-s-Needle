# Buffon-s-Needle
Buffonâ€™s needle is one of the oldest problems in geometric probability. First stated in 1777 by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, it involves dropping a needle onto a series of parallel lines (often described as a collection of parallel wooden floorboards). A remarkable outcome of this analysis is that the probabilities involved are directly related to Pi.
